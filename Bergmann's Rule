```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(broom)

```

Read in file:
```{r}
aquamarine <- read_csv("aquamarine 2.csv")
summary(aquamarine)
write_csv(aquamarine, "aquamarine_lat.csv")
```

Does animal size (mass) change with latitude?

Things to do:
1. Organize data into table with columns: latitude, species, mass of species
2. Convert Latitude column into numeric.
3. Plot latitude against mass and look for relationship.
4. Create linear models.

Data exploration:
```{r}
aquamarine %>% 
  distinct(`Predator common name`) %>% 
  count()

aquamarine %>% 
  distinct(Latitude)

aquamarine %>% 
  count(`Predator common name`)
```
87 species (predators)
27 measurements of latitudes

Convert Latitude column into numeric:
```{r}
?char2dms
?substr

chd <-  substr(aquamarine$Latitude, 3, 3)[1]
chm <-  substr(aquamarine$Latitude, 6, 6)[1]

cd <-  char2dms(aquamarine$Latitude, chd = chd, chm = chm)

num_latitude <- abs(as.numeric(cd))
aquamarine$Latitude <- num_latitude

class(aquamarine$Latitude) #check
```

Next we will plot mass against latitude and look for a relationship. In order to do this, we need to take predator lifestage into account, and compare species accross lifestages.

But first, in coloumn `Predator lifestage`, change data entries "Adult" to "adult":
```{r}
aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  distinct()

aquamarine$`Predator lifestage`[aquamarine$`Predator lifestage` == "Adult"] <- "adult"
```

Grouping species by latitude and lifestage, and finding mean mass of those species:
```{r}
# Calculating mean mass of each species at each latitude
aquamarine %>%
  select(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator mass`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  group_by(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(`Predator mass`))

# Sample size for each lifestage
aquamarine %>% 
  filter(`Predator lifestage` == c("adult", "juvenile", "larva", "larva / juvenile")) %>% 
  group_by(`Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  count()
```

Plot (log-transformed):
```{r}
aquamarine %>%
  select(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator mass`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  filter(`Predator lifestage` == c("adult", "juvenile", "larva", "larva / juvenile")) %>% 
  group_by(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(`Predator mass`)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = mean_mass, colour = `Predator lifestage`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Standardized Mean Mass (kg)")
```
Adult, juvenile, and larva/juvenile lifestages do not seem to follow Bergmann's rule; negative relationships are observed instead of positive. 

We can clearly see sampling is not even across latitude, with lots of data points clustered at Latitude 40 and 50, but few between Latitudes between 15 and 25.

Since there is non-independence of observations, we should run a separate analysis for each lifestage. 
```{r}
# Run linear model of Mass against Latitude for each lifestage
model_1 <- aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator lifestage`, `Predator common name`, Latitude, `Predator mass`) %>% 
  filter(`Predator lifestage` == c("adult", "juvenile", "larva", "larva / juvenile")) %>%
  group_by(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(`Predator mass`)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(pred_name = `Predator common name`) %>%
  dplyr::rename(pred_lifestage = `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  group_by(`pred_lifestage`) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(`mean_mass` ~ Latitude, data = .))

# Get the coefficients by group in a tidy data_frame
df_models = tidy(model_1, mod)

df_models %>% 
  filter(term == "Latitude") %>% 
  dplyr::select(estimate, p.value)
```
Juvenile is the only lifestage that has a significant p-value, but shows a negative relationship (as Latitude increases, mass decreases). Larva is the only lifestage that demonstrates Bergmann's rule, but does not have a significant p-value.

Perhaps a better approach would be see if individual species follow Bergmann's rule. 
Find species that are sampled at two different latitudes and look for a relationship between mass and latitude.

```{r}
# Range of latitude that species are sampled
aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator common name`, Latitude, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(`Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), max = max(Latitude), min = min(Latitude)) %>% 
  arrange(-n)

aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator common name`, Latitude) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(`Predator common name`) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(-n)

# Look at both code chunks and see if n columns are equal for each species. If mismatched, then that species has more than one lifestage sampled. 

# Atlantic cod is found at multiple lifestages. To use only adults, change `Predator common name` to "Atlantic cod adult" in dataframe.

for (row in 1:nrow(aquamarine)) {
  if (aquamarine[row, "Predator common name"] == "Atlantic cod" && aquamarine[row, "Predator lifestage"] == "adult") {
    aquamarine[row, "Predator common name"] <- "Atlantic cod adult"
  }
}

# Check
aquamarine %>% 
  filter(`Predator common name` == "Atlantic cod adult")
```
Species to use:
- Atlantic bluefin tuna
- Atlantic cod (adult only)
- John dory
- Myctophidae fish larva
- Saithe
- Spurdog / spiny dogfish

Create new object that only includes those species and colunns Latitude and Predator mass:
```{r}
aquamarine_species <- aquamarine %>%
  select(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator mass`) %>%
  filter(`Predator common name` == c("Atlantic bluefin tuna", "Atlantic cod adult", "John dory", "Myctophidae fish larva", "Saithe", "Spurdog / spiny dogfish"))

# Sample size for each species
aquamarine_species %>% 
  group_by(`Predator common name`) %>% 
  count()
```

Plot (log-transformed):
```{r}
aquamarine_species %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = `Predator mass`, colour = `Predator common name`)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Standardized Mass (kg)")
```

Observations among species are clustered because of non-independence. We can run separate analysis for each species.
```{r}
aquamarine_species %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = `Predator mass`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Standardized Mass (kg)") +
  facet_wrap(~ `Predator common name`)
```
```{r}
model_2 <- aquamarine_species %>% 
  dplyr::rename(pred_name = `Predator common name`) %>%   
  group_by(pred_name) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(`Predator mass` ~ Latitude, data = .))

df_models = tidy(model_2, mod)

df_models %>% 
  filter(term == "Latitude") %>% 
  dplyr::select(estimate, p.value)
```
Atlantic bluefin tuna and John dory show a positive significant relationship between Latitude and mass. Atlantic cod adult, Saithe, and Spurdog/spiny dogfish show no relationship. Myctophidae fish larva has a significant negative relationship. Therefore we can conclude that Bergmann's Rule can only be observed in the Atlantic bluefin tuna and John dory.
