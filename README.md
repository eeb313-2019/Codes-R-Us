# Codes-R-Us

## Introduction to the project

Our project is about marine predator-prey interactions. We want to study how predator-prey interactions change through different life history stages. Another possible question is: Do more complex communities have more complex interactions? We hope to gain an understanding in applying practical skills that we have learned through this course to investigate ecological problems of which we have interest.

## Description of the data

The dataset is a composite of  marine predator-prey mass data from a variety of studies. It includes taxa, geospatial, and life history stage data, among other metrics. We likely will use some combination of predator-prey mass data and the other variables mentioned above. The dataset was collected by merging many marine predator-prey studies together. We can use the predator-prey mass data, and where present, the life history data to investigate how the predator-prey mass relationship changes through life history stages. We can determine species abundance and richness for each community, then use the R package "foodweb-package" to recreate food webs and enhance our understanding trophic levels and interactions of the species present in the dataset. From this, we will compare the complexity of foodwebs to diversity levels to determine if the two factors correlate.

# Contents 

Master contains 3 separate code files, Bergmann's rule, Predator Prey interactions, and Food webs.

# Contents of folders

The first page of the Codes R Us Github repository has:
  
  - ReadMe File: Contains project information, data description, information about the group members, and key to the rest of the repo
  
  - Conduct File: Contains the Codes R Us code of conduct, group member responsibilities, and plans to resolve conflict should they arise
  
  - Foodweb Code File: file containing code for the food web complexity analysis 
  
  - Exploratory Analysis with Life Stage Code: file containing code for the analysis between predator:prey mass and life stage
  
 Within the opening repo, there is also a 'doc' folder (short for documents). This folder contains
 
  - Objectives File: outlines our hypothesis and predictions for this project

  - Analysis Plan: contains how we plan to address each question, our predicted results, and possible figures we will produce.
  
  - Folder called plots, which contains a folder called mock, which contains: mock plots matching our original questions
