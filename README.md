## Introduction to the project

Our project is about marine predator-prey interactions. We want to study how predator-prey interactions change through different life history stages. Another possible question is: Do more complex communities have more complex interactions? We hope to gain an understanding in applying practical skills that we have learned through this course to investigate ecological problems of which we have interest.

## Description of the data

The dataset is a composite of  marine predator-prey mass data from a variety of studies. It includes taxa, geospatial, and life history stage data, among other metrics. We likely will use some combination of predator-prey mass data and the other variables mentioned above. The dataset was collected by merging many marine predator-prey studies together. We can use the predator-prey mass data, and where present, the life history data to investigate how the predator-prey mass relationship changes through life history stages. We can determine species abundance and richness for each community, then use the R package "foodweb-package" to recreate food webs and enhance our understanding trophic levels and interactions of the species present in the dataset. From this, we will compare the complexity of foodwebs to diversity levels to determine if the two factors correlate.
