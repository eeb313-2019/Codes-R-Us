 November 26 Meeting Minutes

- Leader: Gloria
- Recorder: Mariel
- Organizer: Josh
- Day Off: Sebastian

- More work on data analysis and construction of figures

- Continue work on report

- Begin powerpoint on Google Slides

- Get some of the code into Github and into master



1. Go through comments from mid project report together to address issues

Dropped depth question because depth varied between studies, not within study, so couldn't get any useful abundance data, because dependent on how each study was taken. Too much bias and decided to drop

For Sebastian's model:

- Talked about random effects should use; whether applyin random effects may be difficult

- Need to solidify random effects for the model; some written were continuous variables and can't be used for random effects

- food web looking at number of interactions, not trophic levels, which vary enough for analysis.

- Found 4 food web theories about number of connections and species richness. Will compare results to see which theory it supports

- How do they connect: getting a holistic view of marine predator-prey interactions across space (Bergmann's Rule, food webs), 
   


2. Next steps

- only have two classes left, today aim to finalize all data and graphs, on thursday, start puting together presentation

- Gloria: do more of Bergmann's stuff

- Sebastian: incorporate random effect

- Mariel: 

- Josh: researching for the paper. Abstract and introduction are supposed to be done last, writing the methods first. 
 


3. FOR NEXT MEETING
- Have all figures done
- Josh will continue working on paper
