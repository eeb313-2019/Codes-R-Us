### Question 1: Trophic Cascades

**Food web figures**




potential Figure caption: Predator-prey interactions from 'Geographic Location' as generated by the foodweb package in R

**Scatterplot of Diversity and Trophic complexity**




potential figure caption: Diversity of ecosystem compared to their trophic complexity, where diversity is determined by Simpson's Diversity Index and trophic complexity is equal to the number of trophic interactions in a food web.


### Question 2:
