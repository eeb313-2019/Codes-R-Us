### Question 1: Do more diverse communities have more complex trophic interactions?

**Food web figures**

**Scatterplot of Diversity and Trophic complexity**
potential figure caption: Diversity of ecosystem compared to their trophic complexity, where diversity is determined by Simpson's Diversity Index and trophic complexity is equal to the number of trophic interactions in a food web.


### Question 2: Is the ratio between predator and prey mass (and their variation) constant through life stages?

Potential figure caption: predator mass (g) versus prey mass(g)


### Question 3: Does animal size (mass and length) change with latitude?

Potential figure caption 1: species mass (g) across latitude
Potential figure caption 2: species length (cm) across latitude


### Question 4: How do total abundance and species abundance change with depth?
Potential figure caption: species abundance at different depths (m)
