# Possible analyses

1) Do more diverse communities have more complex trophic interactions?

Simpson's diversity index can be used to determine diversity for each geographic location. Food webs will be created from the "Rfood-web" package. Complexity of the food web will based on number of connections.

2) Is the ratio between predator and prey mass (and their variation) constant through life stages?

A possible analysis that could be used is ANOVA between predator/prey mass for adults and juveniles.

3) Does animal size (mass and length) change with latitude?

We would use a linear model. Fixed effects would be mass, random effects include depth, predator/prey, and feeding type.

4) How do total abundance and species abundance change with depth?

We would use a linear model. Fixed effects would be abundance, random effects include latitude, predator/prey, and feeding type.

# Possible results tables

1) Do more diverse communities have more complex trophic interactions?

A column for diversity index, and a column for number of connections in food web (trophic diversity). Each row will represent a different location.

2) Is the ratio between predator and prey mass (and their variation) constant through life stages?

The output table of the ANOVA, including relationship and strength.

3) Does animal size (mass and length) change with latitude?

We would make a table of a variety of models using various random effects, and compare AIC values.

4) How do total abundance and species abundance change with depth?

We would make a table of a variety of models using various random effects, and compare AIC values.

# Possible results figures

1) Do more diverse communities have more complex trophic interactions?

Scatterplot of diversity index vs number of connections.

2) Is the ratio between predator and prey mass (and their variation) constant through life stages?

Scatterplot of prey mass vs predator mass colored by feeding type. Variation could be represented with a boxplot.

3) Does animal size (mass and length) change with latitude?

Scatterplot of mass vs latitude (or length vs latitude) with a line of best fit based on regression (see lec. 8 pg. 5).

4) How do total abundance and species abundance change with depth?

Scatterplot of abundance vs depth with a line of best fit based on regression.
