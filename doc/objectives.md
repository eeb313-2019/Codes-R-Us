# Study objectives

- Do more complex communities between trophic levels have more complex interactions?

We predict that more diverse communities will have a higher number of interactions. It may look like a logistic curve, where the number of interactions plateaus when species richness increases.

- Is the ratio between predator and prey mass constant through life stages?

We predict the ratio will change through life stages, as diet changes. 

- Does animal mass increase near the poles?

We expect the animal mass to increase nearer to poles, as per Bergmann's rule.

- How do total abundance and species abundance change with depth?

We predict total abundance will decrease with increasing depth, as resources decrease. Diversity would then also be predicted to decrease for the same reasons.
