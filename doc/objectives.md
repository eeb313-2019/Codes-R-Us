# Study objectives

- Is the ratio between predator and prey mass (and their variation) constant through life stages?

We predict the ratio will change through life stages, as diet changes. Variation should increase throughout species' life stages as diet becomes less restricted.

- Does animal size (mass and length) change with latitude? 

We expect the animal size to increase with latitude, as per Bergmann's rule.

- How do total abundance and species abundance change with depth?

We predict total abundance will decrease with increasing depth, as resources decrease. Diversity would then also be predicted to decrease for the same reasons. Temperature will be used to gauge primary productivity.

- Do more diverse communities have more complex trophic interactions?

We predict that more diverse communities will have a higher number of interactions, following predictions of known food web laws like the link scaling species law. It may look like a logistic curve, where the number of interactions plateaus when species richness increases.

- What is the relationship between trophic interactions and latitude

We predict that trophic interactions will decrease with increasing latitude, as the species richness decreases with latitude.
