The organizer of the meeting (see Responsibilities) is in charge of upholding the code of conduct during each work period.

## Responsibilities
Each meeting will have a leader, a note-taker, and an organizer. The remaining person will have 'a day off'.
  Leader: Running work period
  Recorder: Note taking
  Organizer: Making sure group stays on track

At the start of each meeting, we will spend 5-10 minutes:
  1. Updating each other on progress since last meeting
  2. Outline goals for the work period

At the end of each work period
  1. Update on progress of the work period
  2. Determine to-do list for next work period
  
**Schedule**

## Resolving Conflict
Should conflict or debate arise, the matter will be settled by democratic vote.
Should the vote be a tie, the leader of the day will decide the outcome.
If the conflict becomes a reoccuring issue, course instructors will be consulted.
