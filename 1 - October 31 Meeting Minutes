October 31 Meeting Minutes

Data taken
1. Predator                              2. Prey                3. Environment
    - name                                    - name                - geographic location
    - lifestage                               - length              - longitude
    - length (standard, total)                - width               - latitude
    - fork length                             - mass                - depth
    - diet coverage                           - taxon               - temperature
    - taxon                                                         - precipitation
    - feeding interaction type
    - mass

Possible questions to ask:
1. Biogeography: in oceans, life is most diverse/abundant in the poles instead of the tropics
2. Build a food web of a certain location
3. Larger predators eat larger prey
4. Bergmann's rule: expect larger animals near the poles
5. How are size and depth related
6. How are fork length and depth related
7. Lifestage and prey type
8. How interactions (predator-prey) change by environmental factors
9. How size ratios change with eating habitats and location
10. Predator length scales with prey length, same for width and mass
11. Latitude or location and abundance of predator/prey
12. Diversity in predator/prey size as a function of latitude and environment
13. Length to mass ratio with latitude
14. Length to mass ratio with depth
15. Reconstruct a food web

Jobs:

Sebastian: life stage stuff
Josh: predator prey interactions based on size
Gloria: Location
Mariel: Food web
