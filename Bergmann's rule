# Bergmann's Rule

Does animal size (mass) change with latitude?

1. Organize data into table with columns: latitude, species, mass of species
2. Convert latitude column into numeric
3. Plot latitude against mass and look for relationship
4. Create linear models

## Data exploration

```{r}
aquamarine %>% 
  distinct(`Predator common name`) %>% 
  count()

aquamarine %>% 
  distinct(Latitude)

aquamarine %>% 
  count(`Predator common name`)
  
# 87 species (predators)
# 27 measurements of latitudes
```

## Convert latitude column into numeric

```{r}
chd <-  substr(aquamarine$Latitude, 3, 3)[1]
chm <-  substr(aquamarine$Latitude, 6, 6)[1]

cd <-  char2dms(aquamarine$Latitude, chd = chd, chm = chm)

num_latitude <- abs(as.numeric(cd))
aquamarine$Latitude <- num_latitude

# Check the conversion worked

class(aquamarine$Latitude) 
```

## Plot latitude against mass and look for relationship 

In order to do this, we need to take predator lifestage into account, and compare species accross lifestages.

```{r}
# first, in coloumn `Predator lifestage`, change data entries "Adult" to "adult":

aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  distinct()

aquamarine$`Predator lifestage`[aquamarine$`Predator lifestage` == "Adult"] <- "adult"
```

## Group species by latitude and lifestage, and finding mean mass of those species:

```{r}
# Calculating mean mass of each species at each latitude
aquamarine %>%
  select(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator mass`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  group_by(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(`Predator mass`))

# Sample size for each lifestage
aquamarine %>% 
  filter(`Predator lifestage` == c("adult", "juvenile", "larva", "larva / juvenile")) %>% 
  group_by(`Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  count()
```

## Log-transformed plot

```{r}
aquamarine %>%
  select(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator mass`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  filter(`Predator lifestage` == c("adult", "juvenile", "larva", "larva / juvenile")) %>% 
  group_by(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(`Predator mass`)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = mean_mass, colour = `Predator lifestage`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Standardized Mean Mass (kg)")
  
 # Adult, juvenile, and larva/juvenile lifestages do not seem to follow Bergmann's rule; negative relationships are observed instead of positive. 
 # We can clearly see sampling is not even across latitude, with lots of data points clustered at Latitude 40 and 50, but few between Latitudes between 15 and 25.
 # Since there is non-independence of observations, we should run a separate analysis for each lifestage. 
```

```{r}
# Run linear model of Mass against Latitude for each lifestage
model_1 <- aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator lifestage`, `Predator common name`, Latitude, `Predator mass`) %>% 
  filter(`Predator lifestage` == c("adult", "juvenile", "larva", "larva / juvenile")) %>%
  group_by(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(`Predator mass`)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(pred_name = `Predator common name`) %>%
  dplyr::rename(pred_lifestage = `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  group_by(`pred_lifestage`) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(`mean_mass` ~ Latitude, data = .))

# Get the coefficients by group in a tidy data_frame
df_models = tidy(model_1, mod)

df_models %>% 
  filter(term == "Latitude") %>% 
  dplyr::select(estimate, p.value)

# Juvenile is the only lifestage that has a significant p-value, but shows a negative relationship (as Latitude increases, mass decreases). 
# Larva is the only lifestage that demonstrates Bergmann's rule, but does not have a significant p-value.
# Perhaps a better approach would be see if individual species follow Bergmann's rule.

```

## Find species that are sampled at two different latitudes and look for a relationship between mass and latitude.

```{r}
# Range of latitude that species are sampled
aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator common name`, Latitude, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(`Predator common name`, `Predator lifestage`) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), max = max(Latitude), min = min(Latitude)) %>% 
  arrange(-n)

aquamarine %>% 
  select(`Predator common name`, Latitude) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(`Predator common name`) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(-n)

# Look at both code chunks and see if n columns are equal for each species. If mismatched, then that species has more than one lifestage sampled. 

# Atlantic cod is found at multiple lifestages. To use only adults, change `Predator common name` to "Atlantic cod adult" in dataframe.

for (row in 1:nrow(aquamarine)) {
  if (aquamarine[row, "Predator common name"] == "Atlantic cod" && aquamarine[row, "Predator lifestage"] == "adult") {
    aquamarine[row, "Predator common name"] <- "Atlantic cod adult"
  }
}

# Check
aquamarine %>% 
  filter(`Predator common name` == "Atlantic cod adult")
```
Species to use:
- Atlantic bluefin tuna
- Atlantic cod (adult only)
- John dory
- Myctophidae fish larva
- Saithe
- Spurdog / spiny dogfish

## Create new object that only includes those species and colunns 'Latitude' and 'Predator mass'

```{r}
aquamarine_species <- aquamarine %>%
  select(Latitude, `Predator common name`, `Predator mass`) %>%
  filter(`Predator common name` == c("Atlantic bluefin tuna", "Atlantic cod adult", "John dory", "Myctophidae fish larva", "Saithe", "Spurdog / spiny dogfish"))

# Sample size for each species
aquamarine_species %>% 
  group_by(`Predator common name`) %>% 
  count()
```

## Plot (log-transformed)

```{r}
aquamarine_species %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = `Predator mass`, colour = `Predator common name`)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Standardized Mass (kg)")
  
# Observations among species are clustered because of non-independence. We can run separate analysis for each species.
```

```{r}
aquamarine_species %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = `Predator mass`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Standardized Mass (kg)") +
  facet_wrap(~ `Predator common name`)
```

## Linear model

```{r}
model_2 <- aquamarine_species %>% 
  dplyr::rename(pred_name = `Predator common name`) %>%   
  group_by(pred_name) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(`Predator mass` ~ Latitude, data = .))

df_models = tidy(model_2, mod)

df_models %>% 
  filter(term == "Latitude") %>% 
  dplyr::select(estimate, p.value)
```
Atlantic bluefin tuna and John dory show a significant positive relationship between latitude and mass. 
Atlantic cod adult, Saithe, and Spurdog/spiny dogfish show no relationship. 
Myctophidae fish larva show a significant negative relationship. 
We can conclude that Bergmann's Rule can only be observed in the Atlantic bluefin tuna and John dory.
